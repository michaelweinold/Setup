# Setup
Information related to setting up software, hardware and services.

##  Hardware:

### Personal Computer

1. Installing **Asus Utility** software for Asus X570 WS Pro motherboard:

The online product site does not list the required software. Instead, [look for another X570 motherboard](https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/All-series/filter?Category=AMD&Spec=560) and download the Armoury Crate software from one of the product sites. Then from the Armoury Crate, install the required software [AI Suite 3](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1012780/).

## Software:

1. Install and activate **Microsoft Office 2019** on a single PC:

Download a "Microsoft Office 2019 Professional Plus License Key" from EBay (~2-3â‚¬). Activation instructions will read: Add licence key, then proceed with phone activation. If phone activation window does not appear unprompted, go to File > Office Account > "Show Additional Licence Information" > Activate. Then go to e.g. [https://getcid.info](https://getcid.info) to complete licence setup. Note: If motherboard changes, licence is lost. New licence key must be purchased, otherwise activation will fail.
